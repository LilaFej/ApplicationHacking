A simple Python program that prints "hello" 10 times.



I created a simple Python program and compiled it to bytecode, then made a pink HTML page to show the results.

# The Program

The program is in `hello.py`:

for i in range(10):
    print("hello")


It just prints "hello" 10 times!


Created hello.py with a simple loop
Ran this command:

python -m py_compile hello.py
