# A simple Python program that prints "hello" 10 times.

I created a simple Python program and compiled it to bytecode, then made a pink HTML page to show the results.


The program is in `hello.py`:
python
for i in range(10):
    print("hello")


It just prints "hello" 10 times!

Created hello.py with a simple loop
 Ran this command:
python -m py_compile hello.py
I made index.html with a pink background
