# My Python Program

A simple Python program that prints "hello" 10 times.

## What I Did

I created a simple Python program and compiled it to bytecode, then made a pink HTML page to show the results.

## The Program

The program is in `hello.py`:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print("hello")
```

It just prints "hello" 10 times!

## How I Did It

1. **Wrote the program** - Created hello.py with a simple loop
2. **Compiled to bytecode** - Ran this command:
   ```
   python -m py_compile hello.py
   ```
3. **Created HTML report** - Made index.html with a pink background
4. **Published to GitHub** - Ready to share!

## What Got Created

- `hello.py` - The source code
- `__pycache__/hello.cpython-313.pyc` - The compiled bytecode (binary file)
- `index.html` - Pink webpage showing everything

## How to Run

```
python hello.py
```

## What is Bytecode?

Bytecode is a compiled version of the program. Python converts .py files to .pyc files (bytecode) so they run faster. The .pyc file is like a binary file that the computer can execute directly.
